# 📘 FAQ Accordion Component

Welcome to the **FAQ Accordion** project! 🎉  
This is a simple and interactive accordion built using **React**. It's designed to display FAQs in a compact, user-friendly format, allowing users to expand and collapse answers easily. Only one item is expanded at a time! ✨

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Accordion Structure**  
  Clean and semantic HTML structure using `div.accordion`, `div.question`, and `div.answer`.

- 🧠 **Global State Management**  
  Uses React's `useState` to manage which item is currently open. The first item is expanded by default on page load.

- 🔄 **Interactive Behavior**  
  Clicking on a question toggles its visibility, while collapsing any previously opened item.

- 🧩 **Multiple Items**  
  Exactly four FAQ items are rendered, each fully interactive and consistent in structure.
